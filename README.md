Introduction
------------

This repository contains the description of two highly available OpenStack architectures using RDO or Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform:

- An architecture based on [Pacemaker](ha-openstack.md).
- An architecture based on [application-native tools and Keepalived](HA-keepalived.md).

Each architecture includes a description and implementation instructions. Be sure to understand the contrains and limitations of each architecture, and choose the one that better suits your needs.
